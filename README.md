The idea is to develop an leaf disease detection system that can detect and recognize leaves and give result in realtime. The system is implemented by a camera and machine learning algorithms to detect leaf and identified is diseases.


Acquisition of Image Data:
The initial step involves obtaining digital images of plants, both healthy and diseased, under various conditions and stages of growth. This can be done using digital cameras or smartphones, with good lighting conditions and consistent background.

Preprocessing: 
Images are preprocessed to improve quality and make them suitable for analysis. This may include resizing, normalization, filtering (e.g., median filtering for noise removal), and adjusting brightness and contrast.

Segmentation: 
This step involves separating the different parts of the image, such as leaves, stems, and fruits, from the background. Techniques like thresholding, edge detection, and region-growing can be used for this purpose.

Feature Extraction: 
Features that characterize the disease, such as color, texture, and shape, are extracted from the segmented images. This step helps in differentiating healthy plants from diseased ones. For instance, color histogram features can capture color distribution, and texture features like Haralick texture features can describe the texture patterns.

Feature Selection:
Not all extracted features may be relevant for disease classification. Hence, feature selection methods, like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), can be used to identify the most discriminative features.

Classification: 
The selected features are used to train a classifier to identify the disease. Common classifiers used in MATLAB include Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks. The classifier is trained on a labeled dataset, where each image is labeled as healthy or diseased.

Evaluation: 
The performance of the classifier is evaluated using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This is done using a separate set of test images that were not used during training.

Deployment: 
Once the classifier is trained and validated, it can be used to classify new images. This can be done using MATLAB's app-building tools to create a user-friendly interface or by integrating the classifier into a larger system.
